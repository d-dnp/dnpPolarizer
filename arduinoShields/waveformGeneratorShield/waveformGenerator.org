* Description
A waveform generator to sweep microwave frequencies.

It is build around the Arduino Due, DAC0 is used to set the offset,  and DAC1 is used to generate the periodic waveform.

A summing OP amp (AD823, supplied with +/-15 V) is used to generate - (3*V_DAC0 + DAC1). 
The signal is then inverted (AD823).
Then it is fed into a gain = 2 non-inverting Amplifier (again AD823, but powered with +24V / GND. 

At last the signal is filtered by a third order  Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 100 kHz.

* Assembly instructions
Arduino Due mount: Drill holes as per [[file:~/Dropbox/RESEARCH/newPolarizer/arduino/arduinoDrawing.pdf][Drawing]]
(The upper two holes should be used only with insulating supports since they are too close to some pins)

Power supplies: 4 holes 3 - 3.5 mm Diameter on a 46 by 86 mm lattice. 
Supply dimensions are 54 by 96 mm.
* Programming
  [[./Atmel-11057-32-bit-Cortex-M3-Microcontroller-SAM3X-SAM3A_Datasheet.pdf][Datasheet]]
  Range is 0.58 to 2.24 V, see datasheet, p. 1033), according to this [[http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=154965.0][post]]
  Page 1412 specifies the range as 1/6 ADVREF to 5/6 ADVREF
  But ADVREF is 3.3V as can be seen from this [[./schema.jpg][scheme]] taken from this [[http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=193643.0][post]]

  Regarding speed and timing accuracy, a Timer is key and check this post
  http://rcarduino.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/quick-and-dirty-synth-for-arduino-due.html

  So the range is 0.55 to 2.75 V at the DACs outputs.

  The offset (DAC0) is multiplied by 3, and the ramp (DAC0) by one. 
  That signal is then  multiplied by 2, so in total the minimum voltage is
  (* 0.55 4 2) = 4.4 V and the maximum voltage is
  (* 2.75 4 2) = 22 V

  We want to sweep from 12.17 to 13.05V. 
  Since DAC1 is only multiplied by 2, we need to sweep DAC1 by
  (/ (- 13.05 12.17) 2) = 0.44V

  So lets sweep DAC1 from 0.55 to 0.99 V or 20% of its range. 

  This will have an offset of 1.1V, so need to configure DAC0 to give 11.07 V.
  DAC0 is multiplied by 6, so we need to set it to (/ 11.07 6) = 1.845 V.
  This is 1.295V above its base value, corresponding to (/ 1.295 2.2) 58.9 % of its output range.

  (* 4095 0.589) = 2412
  (* 4095 0.2)  = 918

* Ethernet Interface
  An Ethernet interface is implemented. The python module to communicate with the waveform generator is [[~/Dropbox/RESEARCH/newPolarizer/software/waveformGenerator.py][here]].

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import waveformGenerator as wG

address = ('10.1.15.232', 5000)

waveGen = wG.waveformGenerator(address)

wG.set("DAC0", 15)
wG.set("DAC1", 32)
#+END_SRC

** Manual control 
In this mode one can set the values of DAC1 and DAC2 seperately.


* Calibration
Calibration is done by measuring the output with a Keithley 2400 source meter.

We obtain excellent linearity
