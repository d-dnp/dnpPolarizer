This document contains info regarding the wiring of the cryoShield as defined in the eagle [[./cryoShield.brd][file]].

The documentation of the corresponding breakout box can be found here [[/Users/benno/Dropbox/RESEARCH/newPolarizer/cryostats/breakoutBoxOle/breakoutBoxOle.org][here]]

ADG3331 selects the driving potential / current source. 
ADG3332 wires the return path.

See the [[./ADG333A.pdf][manual]].

For Logic 1 Input, Switches switch to the A output

The CS for the AD 7794 was pin 10.

Note that this sketch requires Arduino Pin 4 high to connect the drive current to PIN 1. At the same time Arduino Pin 4 is the Chip Select for the SD functionality.

| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | D3 to D1, Pin 2 to D1 | 

* Probing conditions
Hence for probing the first, second and third resistor with I1, the following pin configurations apply.

Note, that if you want to chase +5V to drive, just set Pin 2 HIGH

The return path connects straight to GND. If you want to connect via 470 Ohm to GND, just set Pin 6 HIGH.

Pin 5 is always low, it connects to Pin 3 and there is no 4th drive pin.
Likewise, Pin 9 is always low, it connects the return path to Pin 4.
