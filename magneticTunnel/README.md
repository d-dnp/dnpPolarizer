# Magnetic Tunnel

## Why 
 
Dissolution-dynamic nuclear polarization (D-DNP) experiments require the use of radical which, when the sample is shuttle through a region of low magnetic field (5 G or so) to a detection magnet, are efficient in driving longitudinal relaxation of the hyperpolarized substance of interest. A magnetic tunnel has therefor been constructed to provide a high magnetic field region between polarizer and detection magnet to minimise the effect of longitudinal relaxation from dissolved radicals.

## Specs 

Permanent magnets are 5 mm x 5 mm x 50 mm in size and were magnetised to 1x10^6 Am^2 through the short axis. A Haibach array was constructed by arranging permanent magnets in a square with alternating polarity as to augment the magnetic field in the centre of the array creating a magnetic field strength of 0.74 T along the majority of the magnetic tunnels is 2.1 m length. Two magnets, from opposite faces, are removed at each end of the tunnel to avoid flipping the direction of the location magnetic field and ensure a smooth, adiabatic transition from polarizer to magnetic tunnel to detection magnet.

## Results

The magnetic tunnel is predicted to save ~14% spin polarization throughout the dissolution process. Enhancement figures for carbon-13 in sodium acetate without the magnetic tunnel is ~1,500 and with the magnetic tunnel is ~3,900.
