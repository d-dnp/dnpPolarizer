* Configuration.

We use three AB sensors with 100 Ohm resistance at room temperature. They are wired with a 0.2  mm diameter copper cable.

The pin numbering is as follows (the first 4 pins drive current through the resistors.

| Pin | What                           | Color in Cable Assembly |
|-----+--------------------------------+-------------------------|
|   1 | Top AB high side               |                         |
|   2 | Top AB low / Centre AB high    |                         |
|   3 | Centre AB low / Bottom AB high |                         |
|   4 | Bottm AB low                   |                         |
|   5 | AD Top + (parallel to wire 1)  |                         |
|   6 | AD TOP -                       |                         |
|   7 | AD centre +                    |                         |
|   8 | AD centre -                    | red-black               |
|   9 | AD bottom +                    | green-black             |
|  10 | AD bottom -                    | orange-black            |
|  12 | NC                             | blue-black              |
|  14 | Cernox current +               |                         |
|  15 | Cernox current -               |                         |
|  16 | Cernox AD+                     |                         |
|  17 | Cernox AD-                     |                         |
